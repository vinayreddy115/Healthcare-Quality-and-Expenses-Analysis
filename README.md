## Model Building
As this is a multi-level data with lower level as time(years), we built the below mentioned Panel regression models using the plm packages 
* pooling model as a baseline model 
* Fixed effects
* Random effects

## Insights and recommendation 
#### Impact of variables on Health Quality
##### postive effect on Health Quality
* Number of hospitals
* Medical graduates, 
* Nurse graduates , 
##### Negative effect on Health Quality
* while deaths by any diseases 
#### Quantitative effects
